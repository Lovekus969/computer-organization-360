SYSTEM/360 ARCHITECTURE — THE CLEAN, EASY BREAKDOWN

The IBM System/360 is one of the most influential computer architectures ever made.
Why? Because it introduced standardized architecture — meaning many machines, one instruction set.

Let’s break it into the major topics you need for your repo and for studying computer organization.

🔥 1. Architecture vs Organization

In computer architecture:
     Architecture = What the computer shows to the programmer
    
    Examples:
    
          Register set
          Instruction set
    
    Data types
    
          Memory addressing
          Input/output model
          Organization = How the computer is built internally

2. System/360 Architectural Highlights
✔️ 2.1 Register Set

System/360 uses 16 general-purpose registers:
    R0 – R15

3. Addressing Modes

    System/360 has:
    ✔️ Base + Index + Displacement

Effective address:
      EA = contents(B) + contents(X) + displacement


This allowed:

          Very flexible addressing
          Good compiler support
          Easy array and structure access
4. Data Types

          Byte (8 bits)
          Halfword (16 bits)
          Word (32 bits)
          Doubleword (64 bits)
          Packed decimal
          Floating point (short, long)
          This is a rich data model for the time.

5. I/O Model — Special Feature

     System/360 used Channels for I/O.
     Channels are mini-CPUs dedicated to I/O.

So:

     CPU gives I/O job to channel
     Channel talks to device
     CPU continues executing instructions

This is the ancestor of:

     DMA (Direct Memory Access)
     Modern I/O controllers

6. Microprogramming

   Most System/360 machines used microprogrammed control units.

     Meaning:
     
         Every instruction → executed by sequences of simpler micro-operations stored in a “control memory”.
     
     This helped them release:
               Low-end models (slow microcode)
               High-end models (faster circuits)
               All still compatible!
