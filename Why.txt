SYSTEM/360 ARCHITECTURE — THE CLEAN, EASY BREAKDOWN

The IBM System/360 is one of the most influential computer architectures ever made.
Why? Because it introduced standardized architecture — meaning many machines, one instruction set.

Let’s break it into the major topics you need for your repo and for studying computer organization.

🔥 1. Architecture vs Organization

In computer architecture:
     Architecture = What the computer shows to the programmer
    
    Examples:
    
          Register set
          Instruction set
    
    Data types
    
          Memory addressing
          Input/output model
          Organization = How the computer is built internally

2. System/360 Architectural Highlights
✔️ 2.1 Register Set

System/360 uses 16 general-purpose registers:
    R0 – R15

3. Addressing Modes

    System/360 has:
    ✔️ Base + Index + Displacement

Effective address:
      EA = contents(B) + contents(X) + displacement
