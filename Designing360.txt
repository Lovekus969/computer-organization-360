IBM System/360, the interrupt system is very structured And see how its organised 

Interrupt Types in IBM System/360

The IBM 360 uses 5 major classes of interrupts:

1️⃣ External Interrupts
    Used for events outside the CPU, such as:
    Timer interrupts
    Operator console signals
    External signals (I/O channels notifying CPU)

➡️ Similar to modern “hardware interrupts.”

2️⃣ I/O Interrupts

Generated by I/O channels when:

    An I/O operation completes
    A device needs attention
    An error occurs during I/O

➡️ IBM 360 uses channel programs, so I/O interrupts are essential.

3️⃣ Supervisor Call (SVC) Interrupts

Generated by executing the SVC instruction.
Used for:

    System calls
    OS services
    Resource requests

➡️ Modern equivalent: trap, syscall, software interrupt.

4️⃣ Program Interrupts

These occur when a program has an error.
Examples:
      Operation exception
      Addressing exception
      Privileged instruction
      Arithmetic overflow
      Protection exception

➡️ Equivalent to “faults” and “exceptions” today.

5️⃣ Machine Check Interrupts

Indicates internal hardware faults such as:

      Memory error
      CPU malfunction
      Faulty registers
      Parity errors

➡️ Used for reliability and recovery.
